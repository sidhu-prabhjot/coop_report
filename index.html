                    A goal that I had relating to the technology stack used at the COA/OAC was gaining proficiency in the Drupal Content Management System (CMS). Drupal is used by the colleges to keep track of website files such as images and documents and prevent repeat code by creating website components that can be reused. Code and file management is of great importance in the technology industry as it allows companies to stay organized, and located resources easily. Furthermore, it saves companies time by allowing them to use polished code once again, instead of creating it from scratch and possibly introducing inconcistences and errors. Popular CMS in the software industry include WordPress, Hubspot, and Joomla. Therefore, I found value developing comprehensive proficiency in Drupal.
                    
                    The first step I took to achieve this goal was to actively participate in training sessions. This included learning the theory, but then going one step further and obtaining practice activities provided by the Central Computing Services (CCS) at The University of Guelph. These allowed me to apply the theory I learned in a test environemt where I was allowed to make mistakes and learn from them. Furthermore, during my time working with Drupal, I was in constant communication with CCS, who managed Drupal, to get constructive criticism. This feedback included points such as how I could optimize the webpages by compressing images, or different methods I could take to create a webpage. These methods includes creating them using HTML or write them up like a Word document.

                    I believe I was able to comprehensively achieve this goal. I can objectively measure this in a variety of ways. First, I was able to successfully complete the training, which indicates I demonstrated a foundational level of knowledge of Drupal. Furthermore, I received positive feedback on designs and new webpages I created using Drupal, which indicates I was making use of Drupal that management wanted. An example of this was my presentation to the Dean's council. After garnering praise for my undergraduate and graduate program webpage redesigns I created, I was invited to present and explain my design philosophy to the Dean's Council, which is now being implemented. A final metric that I had not initially conceieved of was obtain a return offer. I have been asked to come back to work at the COA/OAC as a web developer part-time due to my extensive knowledge of Drupal.
