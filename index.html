                    A goal that I achieved relating to the technology stack used at the COA/OAC was gaining proficiency in the Drupal Content Management System (CMS). Drupal is used by the colleges to keep track of website files such as images and documents and prevent repeat code by creating website components that can be reused. Code and file management is of great importance in the technology industry as it allows companies to stay organized, and located resources easily. Furthermore, it saves companies time by allowing them to use polished code once again, instead of creating it from scratch and possibly introducing inconcistences and errors. Popular CMS in the software industry include WordPress, Hubspot, and Joomla. Therefore, I found value developing comprehensive proficiency in Drupal.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The first step I took to achieve this goal was to actively participate in training sessions. This included learning the theory, but then going one step further and obtaining practice activities provided by the Central Computing Services (CCS) at The University of Guelph. These allowed me to apply the theory I learned in a test environemt where I was allowed to make mistakes and learn from them. Furthermore, during my time working with Drupal, I was in constant communication with CCS, who managed Drupal, to get constructive criticism. This feedback included points such as how I could optimize the webpages by compressing images, or different methods I could take to create a webpage. These methods includes creating them using HTML or write them up like a Word document.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I believe I was able to comprehensively achieve this goal. I can objectively measure this in a variety of ways. First, I was able to successfully complete the training, which indicates I demonstrated a foundational level of knowledge of Drupal. Furthermore, I received positive feedback on designs and new webpages I created using Drupal, which indicates I was making use of Drupal that management wanted. An example of this was my presentation to the Dean's council. After garnering praise for my undergraduate and graduate program webpage redesigns I created, I was invited to present and explain my design philosophy to the Dean's Council, which is now being implemented. A final metric that I had not initially conceieved of was obtain a return offer. I have been asked to come back to work at the COA/OAC as a web developer part-time due to my extensive knowledge of Drupal.

                  <div class="accordion-body">
                    Another goal that I had set and achieved was to enhance my communications skills. More specifically, I wanted to improve my communciation with clients. In the COA, one aspect of my job was receiving requests from faculty and staff regarding changes or fixes for their webpages. Therefore, communication with clients in the COA included understanding the web project they were bringing to me, what issues that they were encountering, and communicating to them how to diagnose and find a solution for it. On the IT side in the OAC, communication with clients involved understanding IT issues they were encountering, software or hardware, and explaining and providing solutions for them that not only work for them in terms of scheduling, but also in terms of the technology specifications they had. Developing my communications skills with clients is crucial in the technology industry. This is because software is developed for clients, whether it be individuals, other companies, or the firm I will be working at itself, and understanding their needs is the only way I will be able provide them the best product possible and develop the reputation of my workplace.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    To improve my communication on the COA side of my job, where I handled web change/fix requests, I increased the volume of web requests I handled. This allowed to me to iteratively build best practices for communicating with clients as I tried different methods of communication. For example, at the beginning I would ask to switch communication from email to Microsoft Teams. My justification behind this was that it would allow for less formal speech and quick responses. However, faculty and staff tended to be more comfortable with the formal tone when discussing on email, so I ended that change I implemenet. Furthermore, I learned to simplify my language to fit the different type of knowledge faculty and staff had. Most facult and staff did not understand many web development terms such as "alt text", and therefore, I had to make the adjustment and explain it in terms that they were more comfortable with. These changes made clients more comfortable and understanding of the request process. The OAC IT side of my job required nearly the opposite adjustments. Most faculy and staff were comfortable with information technology terms and preferred a quick and responsive conversation to get get the IT support they needed. Therefore, I made the shift to Microsoft Teams to have less formal discussions, and was able to maintain my normal IT vocabulary when talking to clients.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I was able to track success in achieving this goal through objective measures. This measure included successful web requests, and IT tickets resolved. I was able to complete every web request that I was given. This shows that my method of communication allowed clients to effectively communicate their issues, and also allowed me to understand their issues. Had I not been able to achieve this goal, there would be cases in which a communication breakdown occured and web requests would not have been fulfilled. The same trend was seen with IT tickets, as I was able to complete all IT tickets that I had the required knowledge to complete and that there were not uncontrollable circumstances obstructing completion. In fact, cases in which I did not have the proper knowledge to complete the ticket, I was able to communicate this to my managers and supervisors and get the support I needed.

                  <div class="accordion-body">
                    An important goal I had set and acheived for this work term was centered on refining critical and creative thinking skills for effective problem-solving while working on web development and IT support. To achieve this goal, I focused on creating a strategic mindset to address challenges with solutions that go beyond convential ones. In IT support, my approach involved comprehensive issue analyssis and practive client engagement. This was to reduce the time it took to solve issues. Concurrently, on the web development side, I aimed to not only address immediate issues, but also anticipate and prevent future challenges. The justification for creating goal is firmly rooted in industry standards. Software is not developed with just current requirements in mind, but also problems that may be encountered in the future. For example, apps like Instagram are developed on cloud infrastructures that enable them to have to millions of concurrent users. However, they also recognize that they will have more users in the future, which is why they would want to use cloud infrastructures, as they are scalable.  This blend of addressing current issues and proactively solving future problems is the mindset I aimed to cultivate during this work term.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Executing this goal involved diversifying my exposure to web development projects and taking on cross-training opportunities. This approach would allow me to acheive a holisitic problem-solving perspective, which would have me doing constant analysis of the web requests and redesigns I completed during my work term. This meant getting feedback from colleagues and clients, and anticipating challenges in future requests and development projects. Furthermore, to achieve this goal I would have to explore innovative solutions and initaite collbarative problem-solving meetings to encourage creativity in finding solutions to common and complex issues. A commitment to regular relfection on past approaches aimed to continuously fine-tune problem-solving strategies, which allowed for continous learning and improvement in both IT support and web development.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Like my other goals, I was able to measure success for this goal through objective measures. Notable ones included reductions in IT support ticket resolution time. The reduction in resultion time indiciated the effectiveness of improved pronblem analysis and direct client interactions. Success in web development was measurable by my ability to handle an increased volume of diverse issues while proactively anticipating and preventing potential challenges. For example, I receieved a request from the French Studies program to redevelop their program page. Initially, they requested for a simple refresh on Drupal 7 (our older Drupal platform) on which their page was deployed on. This could be done, but the University was already in a phase of migration between Drupal 7 to the newer Drupal 9. This meant that French Studies would be in the same position of requesting another redesign, but now, for Drupal 9. Instead of doing a refresh on Drupal 7, it was done on Drupal 9. This not only solved their current issues, but also prevented potential issues in the future. Furthermore, positive feedback from clients and colleagues regarding clarity and creative problem-solving approaches served as a strong indicator of progress.

            As the Website and IT support Coordinator at the University of Guelph, I played a pivotal role in supporting the Colalge of Arts (COA) and the Ontario Agriculture College (OAC) in their IT needs and website management. This complex position involved managing and maintaining the COA website, and transitioning the website from the Drupal 7 CMS to the Drupal 9 CMS. Concurrently, I provided crucial information technology support to faculty, staff, and sometimes students in both the COA and the OAC.
            <br>
            <h3>Website Management</h2>
            On the website management side of the job, I served as a subject mater expert in UX and UI design to make the website user-friendly, and making sure that the COA website was AODA compliant. This was crucial to increasing recruitment by making the website accessible to all. Furthermore, I contributed to the University's website redesign initiative, which included providing feedback on the website strucuture, and user journies. Notably, I actively engaed in maintaince of the current Drupal 7 CMS, and offered guidance to faculty and staff on following the University's predefined brand guide to standardize the styling of university websites. Finally, I worked on migrating outdated and inaccessible webpages on Drupal 7 CMS to the Drupal 9 CMS, which refreshed webpage components, layouts, and improved AODA compliance.
            <h3>IT Support</h3>
            On the IT support front, I provided assitance for a wide range of hardware and software technologies used by University departments. These were particulary focused on networked Windows and MAc personal computers. My duties included diagnosis and resolution, problem tracking using the Footprints ticket manager, client trainging, hardware and software installation and configuration, and liasing with vendors to order new hardware and software products for new faculty or staff, or upgrades for existing faculty or staff.
            <h3>Skills and Qualifications</h3>
            This position required me to have a wide array of skills, qualifications, and knowledge. On the web development front, I needed to know HTML and CSS. Proficiency in these technolgies was required to be able to use the Drupal CMS. Particulary, to develop new components to replace the old ones. This is a skill I picked up through personal projects I developed, and further built upon through courses as a part of the Computer Science program such as CIS 2750. However, this work term did not build upon my HTML and CSS skills, but effectively made use of them. AODA compliance was knowledge that I did not possess much of before this work term. I know the basics such alternate text and colour contrast. However, software I got to use such as SiteImprove taught me of much more about AODA compliance. This included severity levels of AODA incompliance (A, AA, AAA) or header hierarchies being important for screen readers navigating the webpage. The IT support front of my position built my skills with ticket managing systems. Before working in IT during my work term, I had never used a ticket managing software before. In this position, I learned about Footprints, which was the software I used. It allowed me to receive faculty and staff IT issues, communicate, schedule, and track issues as well.

This included both soft skills such as more effective communication and problem-solving, but also hard skills such as web development through the Drupal CMS and Footprints ticket management software.

                    I honed my technological proficiency in Drupal CMS though active participatipation in trainging, but also applying that training to practical hands-on activities, but also using feeback from colleagues, management, and CCS. My technological proficiency was evident from prositive feeback, which opened up the opportunity to present my knowledge and philosophy to the Dean's council.

                    <br>
                    Through enhancing my communication skills, I was able to better understand issues my clients on both the web development and IT support sides were facing. This was supported by an adaptability I obtained in altering my communication to better suit my clients, which made them more comfortable in discussing their situations. These improvements in my communications skills resulted in successful handling of web requests and IT ticket resolutions.

                    <br>
                    Additionally, my work term was truly unique. Having two distinct employers provided a unique experience in a collaborative and team-based culture, emphasiszing creativity but also improvisation.

                    <br>
                    Finally, as the Web and IT Support Coordinator, I played a pivotal role in managing websites, trnaitiioning to Drupal 9, and providing IT support, utulizing a diverse skill set and encouraging continuous learning.

                    <br>
                    To conclude, my work term shaped me into a more proficient, communicative, and strategic professional, well-equpped for future challenges in web development and IT support.
